                    Aspen helps local departments of public health identify the most effective interventions to stop the spread of disease. The secure, cloud-based platform streamlines the analysis of pathogen genomic data and generates phylogenetic trees with a single clickâ€”no need to install software or write code. These analyses help public health laboratorians, epidemiologists and public health officers track outbreaks and variants, and gain an overall picture of how pathogens are spreading in their community.
