/**
 * Moves users away from pages they should not see depending on user status.
 *
 * Primary purpose is to kick off redirects based on user status. If user is not
 * logged in, pushes them to the homepage. If user is logged in but has not
 * agreed to the Terms of Service yet, pushes them to ToS page so they must agree
 * before being able to use the app.
 *
 * Usage is simple: just call the function near the top of the component you want
 * to protect (according to above rules).
 * NOTE: The "protected" component will still render! This just puts in an async
 * call for userInfo data, and has a hook for redirecting based on that data. But
 * it will not prevent render, it just can then push the user away from that page.
 *
 * Returns: (obj) result of `useUserInfo` call
 *   [Could be refactored to have no return, but right now some components use that userInfo.
 *    Might be better to be more explicit though, have components directly call useUserInfo?]
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * This function does not provide "real" security. Think of it as a picket fence.
 * It's only intended to redirect users to where they should be. It does not prevent
 * protected routes/components from firing and would be easy for an attacker to circumvent.
