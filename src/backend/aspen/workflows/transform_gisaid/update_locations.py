    This utility rearranges Nextstrain's GISAID -> Nextstrain locations mapping file
    to instead be a GISAID -> CZ GEN EPI locations mapping file. Some of the locations
    in our database don't follow the Nextstrain location conventions and upstream
    changes to Nextstrain's translations have broken our tree builds in the past.

    This translation file is tab-delimited with one source and destination mapping per line:
    old_location\tnew_location

    There are 4 main changes we make to the file:
    1. There are a few localities we work with that don't want their location rolled
       into a larger area (ex: city into county). Remove these localities from the
       output file.

    2. Remove any rules that translate a location in use by CZ GEN EPI into some other
       name.

       For example, Nexstrain may have a rule like this:
       North America/USA/New York/Orange County    North America/USA/New York/Orange County NY

       If we have a group that's using the "New York/Orange County" location, we want
       to make sure their samples (and any GISAID samples from Orange County) are
       displayed on a tree with the same location name.

    3. For any translations *to* a location that were skipped in #2 above, we need to
       change the new location so it matches the value in use by CZ GEN EPI. For example,
       Nextstrain often rolls up several smaller locations into a larger one like this:
       North America/USA/New York/Middletown    North America/USA/New York/Orange County NY

       But since we skipped mapping "Orange County" to "Orange County NY" above, we want
       to update this rule to look like this:
       North America/USA/New York/Middletown    North America/USA/New York/Orange County

    4. Add a few custom mappings of our own.
