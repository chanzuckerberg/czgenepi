# Environmental vars required for script to run:
# PATHOGEN_SLUG
#   The Pathogen.slug for whatever pathogen we want to run Nextclade on.
# RUN_TYPE
#   What kind of run this is. We use the same overall workflow for running on
#   specific samples and for doing a scheduled refresh job. Setting this value
#   controls which type. See `prep_samples.py` for allowed values.
# SAMPLE_IDS_FILENAME
#   If RUN_TYPE is a run against specified ids, this file has which samples to
#   run Nextclade on and save results for. If other run type, file is ignored.
#   If it's being used, it's a plain text file of sample PK ids, one per line.
#   All samples must be for the same pathogen, same as PATHOGEN_SLUG above.
