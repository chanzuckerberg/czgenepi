    Extracts the lineage name from one of the lineage_notes.txt lines.

    Most lines look like this
        Q.3	Alias of B.1.1.7.3, USA lineage, from pango-designation issue #92
        (note, that's a tab character after `Q.3`)

    to only ever care about non-withdrawn lineages. Similarly, we can ignore
    any "alias" names mentioned (eg, `B.1.1.7.3` above), the alias name is more
    of an academic understanding, not something used for identification.
