This tree is designed to provide a broad overview of the viral diversity in a user’s jurisdiction. It includes samples from the user's jurisdiction and samples from outside of the jurisdiction that are closely related to samples in the jurisdiction. These samples from outside of the jurisdiction provide important context for understanding and interpreting the viral diversity and its evolution within the jurisdiction. If more than 2000 samples are available from the user’s jurisdiction, subsampling will occur with a preference for samples recently submitted to GISAID or uploaded to Aspen.
