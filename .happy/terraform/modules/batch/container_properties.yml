# This is a configuration of AWS Batch container overrides, used by the Terraform resources in this directory.
# See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerOverrides.html for the specification.
# The definition source is in YAML for brevity and readability. It is compiled into JSON by Terraform
# then deployed by Terraform.
#
# Strings of the form ${aws_region} are interpreted by Terraform as variables. Use $${aws_region} to escape if that is not the intent.

# The AWS Batch API requires two resource quotas: vCPU and memory. Memory contention or starvation is more dangerous
# than CPU contention (an OOM condition will cause a job to fail, while lower than expected CPU will just cause it to
# run longer). The Batch scheduler uses both quotas to schedule (pack) jobs onto instances, but only enforces the memory
# quota as a hard limit. We set both quotas to a token value here. The step function overrides the memory quota at
# runtime, causing it to become the concurrency-limiting factor for job packing. (Additional logic is required in
# miniwdl to set the memory hard limits on child containers running WDL tasks.)
