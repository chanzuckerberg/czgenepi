# Local Development Environment

This uses the [Happy Path setup](https://wiki.czi.team/display/TECH/Data+Portal+Happy+Path+--+How+it+works) created by the shared infra team.

## Development quickstart

1. [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If brew is installed run `brew install docker`.
1. [install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install). `pip install pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`
1. Run `pre-commit install` to install all the git pre-commit hooks
1. From the root of this repository, run `make local-init` to build and run the dev environment. The first build takes awhile, but subsequent runs will use cached artifacts.
1. Visit [http://backend.genepinet.local:3000](http://backend.genepinet.local:3000) to view the backend, and [http://frontend.genepinet.local:8000](http://localhost:8000) for the frontend.
1. `make local-dbconsole` starts a connection with the local postgresql db.
1. **Open the source code and start editing!**
   - Modify code in the `src/frontend` directory, save your changes and the browser will update in real time.
   - Modify code in the `src/backend` directory, and the backend api will reload automatically.

### Containers managed by the dev environment

The Aspen dev environment is a set of containers defined in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). The [backend docker image](src/backend/Dockerfile) and [frontend docker image](src/frontend/Dockerfile) are built locally. Update any of these files as necessary and run `make local-sync` to sync your dev environment with these configs.

In addition, there is a "utility" container that is configured very similar to the backend container that's useful for running ad-hoc commands and testing dependency changes.

### Updating frontend/backend dependencies

Both the frontend and backend services will automatically reload when their source code is modified, but they won't automatically rebuild when their dependencies (such as npm or pip package lists) change.

To update frontend changes:
1. add dependency to [src/frontend/package.json](src/frontend/package.json) (or add a new scripts command)
2. run `make local-sync`


To update backend dependencies:

1. add the dependency to [src/backend/Pipfile](src/backend/Pipfile)
2. run `make local-update-deps` (updates Pipfile.lock and updates requirements)
3. run `make local-sync` (rebuilds and initializes containers with new dependency)

### Update Dev Data

The dev environment is initialized with AWS Secrets/S3 data in the [src/backend/scripts/setup_dev_data.sh](src/backend/scripts/setup_dev_data.sh) script, as well as DB migrations from [src/backend/database_migrations](src/backend/database_migrations). To add more data or run migrations, modify these scripts and run `make local-init` to reload the dev environment's data stores.

### External dependencies

The dev environment has no network dependencies, but it launches some extra containers to mock external dependencies:

- [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) to mock AWS
- [OIDC server mock](https://github.com/Soluto/oidc-server-mock) in place of Auth0.
- [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) in place of RDS.

#### TLS Certificate for mock authentication service

Due to browser security considerations, we must run the mock authentication
service using a self-signed certificate. The local-init and local-clean make targets
handle managing a keypair/certificate for each dev env and installing it in the
OSX system keychain.

Details: OIDC requires setting a token, and requires the cookie storing that
token to be stored with samesite=None to work properly. Recent versions of
browsers such as Chrome intentionally only allow samesite=None if the connection
is over a secure network connection i.e. TLS. Thus we need to run even a local
development auth service behind a certificate. We bundle a pre-generated
self-signed cert in for convenience.
